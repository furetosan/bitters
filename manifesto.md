Bitter Engineering
============

Bitter engineering is this website: one I've put together in a hurry, to respond properly to all those people Googling me out there.

> Because small, incremental steps are evolution's own doing.

This web framework consists of Bitters, which uses Express, Jade, Stylus, and Embittered to render a beautiful self-hosted opensource blogging platform for you (and in the future, your non-programmy friends). And it was created and initially developed by [Everett Bogue](http://evbogue.com). Thanks.

### Students

You're most likely one of my students, looking for an obscure equation or number or value. If this is the case, you're in luck! Just go [where students go](/aluno).

### Editing Bitters

Bitters uses Git to maintain content.

To change the contents of the main frame

	$ vim readme.md 

To change the contents of the sidebar

	$ vim sidebar.jade

### Deploy Bitters

You'll need a VPS with Node.js installed to deploy Bitters. We recommend [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=26d8ed49730d) (rewards link). Get a Linux VPS for only $5 a month.

### Bitters Development Goals

Our aim is to keep the Bitters core small, while implementing the features we believe are important to bringing Bitters to more people.

Our next development goal is to **add a front-end editable compose window and a backend database**. We're investigating database options and CouchDB is looking like the best candidate. 

There are two ways you can help the above come into the world.

**1** Submit merge requests. Prototype your proposed change on a branch of Bitters, and submit a request to merge the pull when you think it's ready.

**2** Contribute to Bitters development. Major breakthroughs happen with more funding. If you have money, send some our way. We'll use it to buy tacos and beer. Later, we'll attempt to drink our bitterness away while building a better way to publish.


+ **Current mood:** Productive
