About
=======

Although it might seem like I'm facilitating comprehension by explaining, I believe the more I sincerely attempt to help anyone, the more I'll be messing with their lives.

> Working with as-small-as-possible pieces of software and leaps in development.

The main motivation is to slice so-called work into pieces irrecognizable enough so that people - i.e. myself - won't mind taking them on just for fun.

### Quick answers

I just want to know more about you...?

No, you don't. Please don't lie.

**1** install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

**2** type these commands into your terminal

	$ git clone https://github.com/evbogue/bitters.git
	$ cd bitters

**3** navigate to [http://localhost:7777/](http://localhost:7777/) to see your bitters

### Editing Bitters

### Deploy Bitters

You'll need a VPS with Node.js installed to deploy Bitters. We recommend [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=26d8ed49730d) (rewards link). Get a Linux VPS for only $5 a month.

### Bitters Development Goals

Our aim is to keep the Bitters core small, while implementing the features we believe are important to bringing Bitters to more people.

Our next development goal is to **add a front-end editable compose window and a backend database**. We're investigating database options and LevelDB is looking like the best candidate. 

There are two ways you can help the above come into the world.

**1** Submit merge requests. Prototype your proposed change on a branch of Bitters, and submit a request to merge the pull when you think it's ready.

**2** Contribute to Bitters development. Major breakthroughs happen with more funding. If you have money, send some our way. We'll use it to buy tacos and beer. Later, we'll attempt to drink our bitterness away while building a better way to publish.
