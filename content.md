### What is Bitters?

You're looking at Bitters right now.

Bitters is a simple-as possible website built with Express, Jade, Stylus and deployed using Node.js.

Bitters uses Git as a replacement for bulky CMSes. You maintain your content using Git. Use your favorite text editor to write, publish, and deploy your work to the web.

### Why Bitters?

> "I installed bitters a couple of days ago. I went "wooooaaaoooow" like Keanu Reeves. Like taking acid for the first time.
Just 4 lines of code immersed me in all these new technologies –git, node, markdown– stuff I'd only toyed with before." -[Marc Eglon](http://eglon.net), June 2013

Bitters acknowledges when we abstract away 'the hard stuff', we also lose the magic of publishing to the web. By learning how to deploy ourselves, we gain freedom and independence on the distributed web.

Bitters came into being as a reaction to Gwen and Ev's ongoing frustration with 'user-friendly' website 'solutions'. 

Those of us using Bitters do so because we know the only way to have the freedom to express ourselves online is to know our full stack.

### What do I need to run Bitters?

You'll need a VPS (virtual private server) with root access running Linux or Mac OS X with Git and Node.js installed.

### What do I need to know?

Using Bitters you'll get practice [using Git](http://git.gwenbell.com) in a deployment environment, and how to [deploy Node.js](http://deployno.de) to the distributed web. By the time you've deployed Bitters, you'll have a grasp of how to use Node.js and Git.
